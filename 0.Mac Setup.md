# Setting up a new Mac
There are couple of settings I have developed for myself over the years in developing a machine that is productive for me to the core. This isn't the **ultimate productive mac setup**. This is my personal setup to improve my productivity and keep it in sync with different machines I operate / re-setup my machine after factory reset.
